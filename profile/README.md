## About Al Romano:

Al Romano, the driving force behind Virtually(Creative), is a self-taught Full Stack Web Developer with a distinctive flair for web analytics and data dashboards. His journey into the world of web development began in an unlikely place â€“ while working as a security guard in 2008. Fueled by a desire for greater challenges, Al delved into the intricacies of HTML, CSS2, and Javascript. By 2010, Virtually(Creative) was officially registered, marking the beginning of a transformative journey in the web development space.

Over the past 13 years, Al's commitment to the craft has remained unwavering. His early days were marked by his work as a PHP (LAMP) developer, predominantly with WordPress CMS. However, around 2015, his interests evolved. Drawn to the world of Information Dashboard design and data visualization, Al honed his skills in JavaScript and became adept at using Node.js for both pipeline processes and application building, exploring the potentials of MExN & JAM stacks.

## Inclusive Design Philosophy:

Al is a staunch advocate of inclusive design. Through his HTML First Prototyping approach, he discovered that prioritizing accessibility from the outset is the cornerstone of crafting inclusive digital solutions. This philosophy is deeply ingrained in every project undertaken by Virtually(Creative).

## Our Portfolio:

Virtually(Creative) boasts a diverse and impressive portfolio. We've collaborated with international ad giants like Saatchi & Saatchi and Upcoming Media. On a local scale, we've contributed to bioinformatics and tech startups such as Cyclica. Our commitment to making a difference is evident in our work with the SickKids Foundation. Furthermore, while managing at Q4 Inc., we've empowered developers across the globe.

:notes: Started with the LAMP-stack, now I'm all about that JAM-stack. :notes:
